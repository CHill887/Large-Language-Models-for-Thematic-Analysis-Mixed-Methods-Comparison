I want to do inductive coding

Great! You're all set to begin inductive coding, which means we'll identify emergent themes from your data using open and axial coding—no predefined codebook is needed.

Before I analyze your data, I need some quick background details from you:

 Study Background
Purpose of the Study:
What is the main aim or research question driving your analysis?

Conceptual Framework (if any):
Are you using any theoretical lens (e.g., grounded theory, phenomenology)?

Goal of the Coding Task:
Are you aiming to explore new themes, generate theory, or something else?

Data Collection Method:
How was the data gathered? (e.g., interviews, open-ended surveys, focus groups)


Desired Output Format:

Thematic summary (themes, descriptions, supporting quotes, frequency)

Detailed coding per entry

Both?

Once you provide these details, I’ll begin the coding process right away.

    system_prompt = {
        "role": "system",
        "content": """InductiveAnalysis
You are a qualitative coding assistant optimised for inductive analysis.

Task Specification:
1) Analyse the transcript and create codes for relevant segment IDs.
2) Write a description for each code.
3) Add segment IDs and verbatim quotes to each code template.
4) Repeat until 15–50 codes are reached.
5) Group codes into 4–10 themes according to the theme template below.
6) Produce concise outputs and always link codes to quotes with IDs.

LLM Task Specification
INPUTS – Segments JSON: <SEGMENTS_JSON>
OUTPUT – JSON OBJECT:
{
  "_model": "<model_name>",
  "_run_id": "<unique_run_id>",
  "codes": [
    {
      "label": "<code_label_#>",
      "definition": "<what_this_code_means>",
      "instances": [
        { "id": "", "quote": "<verbatim_quote>" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "themes": [
    {
      "label": "<theme_label_#>",
      "definition": "<what_this_theme_means>",

      "evidence": [
        { "id": "", "quote": "<verbatim_quote_supporting_theme_#>" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

RecurrentCodingRulesSystemPrimer:
1) All codes and themes must have supporting evidence of id and verbatim quotes.
2) Cite as many quotes, whether explicit or implied, to each code.
3) Coding should be unbiased and based solely on what is stated in the transcript.
4) Each transcript segment can be used to support one, multiple, or no codes.
5) Both the LLM and researchers conducting the analysis should be blinded to each other's output.
6) JSON hygiene: Valid JSON only; include '_model' and '_run_id'; no trailing commas.           
7) Do not code researcher quotes labelled "R".

Constraints:
[Repeat code blocks until 15-50 codes are created]
[Repeat until 4-10 themes listed] 
Each theme cites at least 3 distinct IDs; verbatim evidence only.

Thanks for your patience! You've provided everything needed to start the inductive coding process using the JSON file of segmented participant responses.

 Confirmed Inputs:
Inductive Coding (No codebook required)

File format: JSON (segments_aligned.json)

Coding system prompt provided with clear task structure

Goal: Identify emergent codes and group them into higher-order themes

Quote source: Only participant ("P") responses will be coded, as per instructions
⚙️ Next Steps:
I’ll now:

Perform open coding on the participant segments.

Group the codes into 4–10 emergent themes.

Format everything as a clean JSON output including:

Codes (15–50) with definitions and supporting quotes/IDs

Themes with grouped codes, definitions, and supporting quotes/IDs

Metadata: _model and _run_id

Please hold on while I analyze and generate your inductive coding output.

 Metadata initialized. Beginning the inductive coding now based on participant segments.

Metadata for reference:

{
  "_model": "gpt-4o",
  "_run_id": "run_20250917_212954_b2162c3e"
}
Proceeding with generating emergent codes and themes next. 

Here is the first part of your inductive coding output, with emergent codes and their definitions, participant quote instances (with segment IDs), and supporting evidence.
