| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dataprocessing.R`                | Loads, validates, and aligns coder data from CSV files.                                                                |
| `Table 1 - comparative metrics.R` | Computes inter-rater reliability metrics (Cohen’s κ, Gwet’s AC1, F1, sensitivity, specificity) and summary statistics. |
| `Table 2 - Cohen's k by theme.R`  | Calculates κ for each theme and exports formatted table.                                                              |
| `Figure A.R`                      | Generates forest plots of ΔAC1                                        |
| `Figure B.R`                      | Produces forest plots for inductive (Likert-scale) data.                                                               |
| `Table 4 - Quote verification.R`  | Summarizes coding agreement and quote-level verification outcomes.                                                     |
